                SMART Goals explained
            </h1>
            <p>
                S.M.A.R.T. is a mnemonic for setting and achieving realistic goals. Here we'll explain a bit about each part of
                the acronym and how you can use it to get stuff done effectively! To find <i>even</i> more about S.M.A.R.T., you can visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">this website</a>.
            </p>


            <div class="two_column_explanation">
                <h1>Specific</h1>
                <p>The first letter of the acronym stands for "specific". What is meant by this, is that your goal should only
                    cover one topic. Don't give yourself the goal to fix things around the house. That's too broad. Rather, give
                    yourself the goal to call a plumber, and wash the dishes. This way you will know what needs to be done.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="two_column_explanation">
                <h1>Measurable</h1>
                <p>Secondly, your goals have to be somewhat quantifiable. There does not have to be a proper recognised metric that
                    indicates progress, but you do have to have something that you can interpret as progress. For example, if you are
                    working on a project, you there will be things that indicate progress as you go. Whether you finished writing a
                    report or talking to a client, etc.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="two_column_explanation">
                <h1>Assignable</h1>
                <p> If you are working in a team, you have to be able to split the goal amongst other team members. It is very hard to
                    work on a goal if there are no parts that can be split up and everyone has to work on the same part.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="two_column_explanation">
                <h1>Relevant</h1>
                <p>Your goals also have to be realistic. Don't give yourself the goal to fix world hunger. It is too big for one person
                    or team to achieve. A more realistic goal could be to apply for a charity or setting one up yourself.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="two_column_explanation">
                <h1>Time-bound</h1>
                <p>Lastly, you have to give yourself a time limit. Goals have to be achieved at some point. This way you give yourself a
                    deadline and an end date to work to.
